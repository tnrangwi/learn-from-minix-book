Memory check:
- Rebuild with -D MEM_DEBUG - this will write messages about all alloc / free
  and realloc.
- Run test code to filter this through AWK script, e.g.:
  sh: ./memtest.trsh 2>&1 >/dev/null | awk -f memchk.awk
  csh: ./memtest.trsh |& awk -f memchk.awk
- Check oputput: awk chwecks all alloc / free output by MEM_DEBUG and rememers
  unfreed memory.

Bugs:

- AWK parses all lines starting with A / F for alloc / free and ignores
  remainder. This requires no additional output to stderr starting with
  F / A.
- Test script - path to trsh most probably needs adjustments in she-bang.
- AWK has no knowledge about global allocs. These always are marked although
  this is not an error. E.g. the shell status is freed by exit of the process.
